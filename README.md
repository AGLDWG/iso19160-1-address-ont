# ISO19160-1 Address ontology
This ontology is an expression of the ISO TC211, Group for Ontology Management (GOM)'s OWL ontology interpretation of the ISO19160-1:2015 "Addressing -- Part 1: Conceptual model" standard (see https://www.iso.org/standard/61710.html) taken from that ontology's source code, published at https://github.com/ISO-TC211/GOM/tree/master/isotc211_GOM_harmonizedOntology/19160-1/2015. This version uses different URIs for the ontology since the original ontology's URIs do not resolve. These new URIs resolve through the [Australian Government Linked Data Working Group](http://www.linked.data.gov.au)'s redirect services. Additionally, this version adds some metadata, such as this explanation, and includes a human-readable (HTML) version of the ontology that has been partly auto-generated from the RDF using [pyLODE](https://github.com/rdflib/pyLODE/).

If/as the GOM's version of the ontology evolves, we will keep this version up-to-date as we intend to only publish an easier-to-access version of their ontology here, not to profile it.

This ontology is online in HTML and RDF forms at:
