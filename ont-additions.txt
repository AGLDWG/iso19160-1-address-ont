rdfs:comment """This ontology is a version of the ISO TC211, Group for Ontology Management (GOM)'s OWL ontology interpretation of the ISO19160-1:2015 "Addressing -- Part 1: Conceptual model" standard (see https://www.iso.org/standard/61710.html) taken from that ontology's source code, published at https://github.com/ISO-TC211/GOM/tree/master/isotc211_GOM_harmonizedOntology/19160-1/2015. This version uses different URIs for the ontology so that they can be made to resolve through the Australian Government Linked Data Working Groups redirect services where the original ontology's URIs do not resolve. Additionally, this version adds some metadata, such as this explanation, and includes a human-readable (HTML) version of the ontology. As the GOM's version of the ontology evolves, we will keep this version up-to-date as we intend to only publish an easier-to-access version of their ontology here, not to profile it. """@en .
